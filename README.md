# myMD code

Java based full fledged molecular dynamics simulation code supporting
standard gromacs input files

## Features
### Parallel Computing
parallel computation on a distrubted memory system(e.g. cluster computer) is supported through MPJ express library. Current version supports domain decomposition which results in better scaling performance. 
### Compatible with standard Gromacs input files
can use standard Gromacs like input files (e.g. *.gro, *.itp, *.top) allowing one to use this code to complement package programs.
### Customizable
unlike package programs, myMD code is developed as a flexible tool to suit various different types of simulations. Document explaining full API will be provided in the near future.
